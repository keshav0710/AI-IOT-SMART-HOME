# AI IoT Smart Home System

## Project Overview
This is a Smart Home Automation system developed as a college project using
IoT, web technologies, and AI integration.

The project enables real-time monitoring and control of home devices such as
lights, security sensors, and appliances through a web dashboard and IoT hardware.

> Note: The initial frontend structure was scaffolded using Lovable to speed up UI setup.
> All core logic, integrations, and project architecture are designed and implemented by me.
